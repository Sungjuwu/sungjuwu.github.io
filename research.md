**Foreign Ownership and Firm Response to Foreign Demand Shocks** <br>

    <summary><span style="color:#012169"><u>Abstract</u></span></summary><p>This paper studies firm response and welfare implication of foreign demand shocks in a developing country when foreign-owned firms repatriate their gains. Using an enterprise survey in Vietnam, I first show that trade activities in Vietnam are predominantly conducted by foreign-owned manufacturers rather than domestic ones, even conditional on firm size. Exploiting the US-China trade war episode in 2018-2019 as a positive foreign demand shock to all Vietnam-based manufacturers, I provide evidence that the positive responses in input sourcing, product export, and employment are mainly driven by foreign-owned manufacturers, especially Chinese manufacturers. Motivated by the findings, I develop and estimate a quantitative model of trade participation with foreign ownership, where domestic and foreign-owned firms differ in their productivity, fixed costs of sourcing and exporting, as well as whether they retain net profits in Vietnam. The welfare contribution of a simulated demand shock to Vietnam similar in magnitude to the trade war would be 15 percent higher if foreign-owned manufacturers were to retain all their profits locally.</p>

    <summary><span style="color:#012169"><u>Abstract</u></span></summary><p>This paper studies how liberalizing outward foreign direct investments (FDI) affects manufacturers' engagement in global production and their domestic workers' labor market outcomes. Focusing on a liberalization policy in 2001 by the government of Taiwan that allowed 122 electronic products to be produced in China, we estimate its effect on Taiwanese electronic manufacturers and their domestic workers. Employing a matched difference-in-differences strategy, we find that the manufacturers targeted by the policy were on average 16% more likely to invest in China relative to the non-targeted ones. Correspondingly, the domestic workers initially employed by the targeted manufacturers were on average more likely to change their jobs, stay employed for fewer years, and have lower wages in subsequent years relative to those employed by the non-targeted ones. The worker-level effects of the policy exhibited substantial heterogeneity across the initial wage distribution, with the top-decile workers benefiting and the other workers losing on average.</p>
