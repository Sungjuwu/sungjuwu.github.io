  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper studies how liberalizing outward foreign direct investments (FDI) affects manufacturers' engagement in global production and their domestic workers' labor 
  market outcomes. Focusing on a liberalization policy in Taiwan that permits 122 electronic products to be produced in China, we estimate its effect on Taiwanese electronic manufacturers 
  and their domestic workers. Employing a matched differencein-differences strategy, we find that the manufacturers targeted by the policy are on average 15% more 
  likely to invest in China relative to the non-targeted ones. Correspondingly, the domestic workers initially employed by the targeted manufacturers are on average 
  more likely to change their jobs, stay fewer years employed, and have lower wages in subsequent years relative to those employed by the non-targeted ones. 
  The worker-level effects exhibit substantial heterogeneity across the initial wage distribution, with the top-decile workers winning and the other workers losing.
