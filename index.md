**Welcome to my website. I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at Duke University.**

**I am on the 2023/2024 job market and will be available for interviews.**

My research interests include international trade, development, and political economy, with a focus on how international trade and investments affect economic development. My job market paper investigates the welfare implication of foreign demand shocks in Vietnam when foreign-owned manufacturers repatriate their profits.

Here is my <a href="https://sungjuwu.github.io/documents/CV_sungjuwu.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="color:#012169"><u>CV</u></span></a> and <a href="https://sungjuwu.github.io/documents/research_statement_sungjuwu.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="color:#012169"><u>research statement</u></span></a>.
